Quick Heal - Data Backup & Restore Backup
-----------------------------------------------------------
Data Backup automatically and periodically (multiple times a day), takes a backup of all your important and common files including PDF, Microsoft Office files, Tally accounting data, and Busywin accounting data in a safe folder on your computer. If you update any file, the feature will automatically take the backup of the latest copy.

This safe folder is created by the Data Backup feature of Quick Heal. Taking the backup of the data is important as you can restore your data whenever required. For example, if any Ransomware encrypts the data on your computer, you can easily restore the backed up data without falling a victim to such threats. Hence it is recommended that you always keep Data Backup turned on. However, this feature is turned on by default.
